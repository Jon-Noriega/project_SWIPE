<h1>freeAGENT</h1>
freeAGENT was designed to get friends together in short order. We are an event-based instant messaging app. Event messages come equipped with built-in countdown timers. If you really want to join in on the event then you have to act fast before the event disappears.
<br></br>
<h2>General Info</h2>
<p>
We strive to connect friends through a real-time, bidirectional, event-based messaging platform. Don't wait too long though, you might miss your opportunity to join in on the fun if you dont click before the event message disappears.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>
My inspiration for this project came about early days pandemic (April 2020). With lock-down restrictions easing in Denver, our friend group was eager to get out for bike rides through the city. We were missing: eachother, being outdoors, and the freedom that comes with being on your wheels. So we began messaging about daily bike rides but it was hard to rally the whole group for a set time. Often times we wouldn't hear from everyone until late afternoon, at which point some early commits had already backed out of the ride. What if there was a way to facilitate more timely responses from all groups members? Cue up disappearing event messages! The core feature of swiftly was born.
